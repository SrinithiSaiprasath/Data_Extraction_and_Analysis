Details about parameters 
1.Accuracy represents the percentage of 
correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
2.Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted 
positive observations to the total predicted positives.
3.Recall (Sensitivity) is the ratio of correctly 
predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
4.F1-Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall.
5.Support is the number of actual occurrences 
of the class in the specified dataset
